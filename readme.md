# How to Play:
Each player has 3 dice with values concealed from other players. Players take turns either guessing a number and how many dice they believe currently have that number for all players or challenging the previous player's guess.

Players are required to guess a higher number than the previous player, either by increasing the number of dice for the current value or increasing the value.

Dice with a value of 1 are wild - they count as whatever the current player's guessed value is.

When a player challenges a guess all dice are revealed. The player who was wrong loses a die.

The game ends when only one player is left with dice.
